# National Dental Examining Board of Canada Robot

In this program, I implemented a robot that continuously checks the National Board of Dental Examiners of Canada and checks if a new position is open for registration in the exam. 

If a position is open, the person applying for the test will be contacted so that the person can complete the registration process.


Also, every time this program is run, it leaves a log of how it works, which includes a brief explanation, the date and time the line was created.
